# araw[^1]

Given a file path/string, this program intends to print the raw version of
that text; so newlines and tabstops will be printed alongside the userside
content.

While originally intended for programming assistance...

e.g.
You need to know how to delimit a file to extract the raw data.

... but now it's really just meant to be a nifty tool, and not much more.

# Installation

Clones the repo, builds the binary and gives you a live demonstration.

```
git clone https://github.com/hazveg/araw
cd araw
make
./araw src/main.c
```

[^1]: stands for 'as raw'
